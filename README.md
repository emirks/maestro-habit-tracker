# Molecular Momentum - Habit Declaration Discord Bot

This project is a Discord bot designed to help users declare and track their habits in a structured way within a Discord server. The bot allows users to submit a habit declaration through a slash command (`/declare`), and it posts the declaration to a designated channel for tracking.

## Features

- **Slash Commands `/declare`:** Users can declare a habit with specific inputs such as Habit, Cue, Frequency, Implementation Intention, and Commitment.
- **Interactive Components:** The bot presents a form to users with text inputs and select menus to ensure habits are declared in a structured format.
- **Automated Posting:** After a user submits their habit, the bot automatically posts the formatted declaration to the `#habit-declaration` channel.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `discord.py` library (version that supports interactions and slash commands)
